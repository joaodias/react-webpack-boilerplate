# React webpack boilerplate
A ready to go initial setup for your react webpack projects. You should have node installed (I recommend you to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)).

- First, check the `package.json` and install the dependencies using `npm install`.

- After installing the dependencies run `webpack-dev-server`. It should build smoothly.

- Ready to go! You can now add your components :)
